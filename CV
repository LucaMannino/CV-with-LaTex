\makecvtitle

\small{Currently working in a clinical lab performing qPCR COVID-19 tests I have recently graduated from Leicester University with a master's in Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics. I am very passionate and intrigued by the power coding and new computing algorithm can have in answering important biological and genetics problems. I am very excited at the prospects of doing a PhD where I might be able to use and improve my academical and professional skills.}

\subsection{Research Projects}

\vspace{3pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Masters Project :} \textit{'Development of a novel blood molecular algorithm for diagnosing dementia'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This was a multidisciplinary project involving Neurological Science, Mathematics and Molecular Genetics university departments. The project consisted analysis heterogeneous data including Protein Biomarkers levels and Biological Data and Psychological clinical test scores in order to discriminate different patient groups. The patient groups included healthy individuals, Alzheimer Disease, Lewis Body Dementia and Vascular Dementia. To analyse the data I used RStudio, I performed both statistical analysis and mathematical modeling such as PCA clustering.\newline
Currently I am working with my supervisor and a team from Nottingham towards publishing a similar topic.}}

\vspace{2pt}

\item{\textbf{BSc Third year group project:} \textit{'Enzyme kinetics of Xanthine Oxidase'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{My third-year group project was on polyphenols and the enzyme kinetics of xanthine oxidase, the study was completed using a Micro-plate Reader and sigma-plot for statistical analysis. Microplate reader ... was used to estimate the effect xanthine oxidase has on oxidative species. The purpose of the study was to estimate the validity of polypheols in diet to reduce the oxidative species produced by xanthine oxidase rewrite!}}

%\vspace{6pt}

%\item{\textbf{Industrial Project with Leyland Motors Ltd:}\textit{'Development of a Facility to Ensure the Achievement of Torque Parameters for a Specific Axle Configuration'}

%\vspace{3pt}

%\small{In the 3rd year of my course I spent a week completing an industrial project for Leyland Motors. I worked with a team operating as consultants for a particular problem the company was having. During this project I was working in a professional environment, and co-operating with various managers and engineers to create a design that met the requirements of the problem.}}

\end{itemize}

\section{Previous Experience}

\begin{itemize}
\vspace{3pt}
\item{\cventry{October 2020--Present}{Scientist}{Source Bioscience}{Nottingham}{}{\vspace{3pt}I am working in the infectious disease laboratory to carry out q-RT-PCR assay to determine the presence of COVID-19 in nasal and throat swab tests. Main duties consist in nucleic acid extraction and purification (DNA/RNA), set-up of RT-qPCR assays and analysis of qPCR data. I also help with development and validation activity within the COVID-19 unit. The team consist in 1 supervisor, 3 scientists and 10 medical lab assistants, MLAs; as a scientists I help supervise the MLAs and assist the supervisor in laboratory logistics.}}

\vspace{3pt}

\item{\cventry{2018--2019}{Laboratory Technician}{ALS foods and pharmaceuticals}{Chatteris}{}{\vspace{3pt}     
Duties involved protein quantification using nitrogen analysers produced by LECO as well as sugar content quantification using IC-HPLC.
My responsibilities included setting up the instruments and running calibrations as well as analysing the results produced. Troubleshooting was also an important part of the job as if the equipment would fail I would have to figure out why and how to fix it if possible.
I was also carrying out routine calibration of LECOs nitrogen analyser and other equipment’s such as pipettes and balances. }}



%\item{\cventry{January 2008}{Assistant Electrician}{Ryan Electricals}{Southport}{}{\vspace{3pt}I spent a week working as an assistant electrician as part of my high school work experience. My roles included wiring plugs, tidying, and assisting with household electrical repairs and fittings.}}

\end{itemize}

\section{Interests and extra-curricular activity}

\vspace{3pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{I like to improve my coding skills by completing online courses on Coursera. I have completed a course on statistics on RStudio and I am now following a course on machine learning.

\vspace{3pt}

\item{I am currently working with my masters' dissertation supervisor and a team from Nottingham University towards a paper. I am really glad and excited to be able to contribute to reserch. The topic is CFS biomarkers in dementia patients and my contribution is mainly data analyssis such as sample size calculations, PCA for clustering analsyis and stitistical calculations.}
